<p class="lead">No need to pore over page after page of cryptic API documentation (although, <a href="{{ site.url }}/docs">you're more than welcome to</a>). Feel free to pick and choose from the hand-written tutorials available, covering the stuff you need to know to hit the ground running.</p>

<p>Are you completely confused and have no clue what to read first? <a href="{% post_url 2000-01-01-setting-up-flashdevelop %}">Why not start from the top?</a></p>
